## Introduction
FLIP4 is a federated learning-based framework for in-network traffic analysis. This repo is the artifact for the paper "Federated In-Network Machine Learning for Privacy-Preserving IoT Traffic Analysis" published on ACM Transactions on Internet Technology. [PDF](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3696354)

## Prepare your environment
This setup is based on [BMv2](https://github.com/p4lang/behavioral-model) in Ubuntu 20.04.

Please make sure the following packages are installed by running: 
```
$ pip3 install -r ./requirements.txt
```
ðŸ’¡ To run the demo on Raspberry Pi, please follow the [P4Pi](https://github.com/p4lang/p4pi) guideline to configure the environment. 

## Run a demo
To run this code: 
1. Navigate to a use case folder (use case with dataset $CIC-IDS2017$ as an example here), compile and run the BMv2 environment:
```
$ cd use_case_cic
$ make clean && make run
```

2. Open a new terminal to run a server:
```  
$ python3 fedavg.py
```
3. Open a new terminal to run clients on switches:
```  
$ python3 FL_controller.py
```

* The source of the dataset: [CIC-IDS2017](https://www.unb.ca/cic/datasets/ids-2017.html)
